IlabServiceBroker and ExperimentStorage
---------------------------------------

These two projects provide enough functionality to run Batch LabServer experiments. The IlabServiceBroker provides SOAP
and RESTful interfaces for the Batch LabClients.


LabsideScheduling and UsersideScheduling
----------------------------------------

The web application frameworks for the LabsideScheduling project and UsersideScheduling project have been provided although
there is no implementation at this time apart from 'SelfRegistration'. It is possible to register these services within the
IlabServiceBroker but nothing more. At some later time, these services can be implemented.
